# worker-create
Create a worker without using a seperate worker.js file

You are using some minifier to bundle all your Javascript files in an easy deployable min.js file and you want to include workers? Look no longer ... worker-create is for you!

### Usage

 - Worker.create(funcOrString);    //returns a worker
 - Worker.createURL(funcOrString); //returns an url


### Usage examples for Worker.create:

Use when you only need one worker!

    var worker = Worker.create(function(e){         //from function
      self.postMessage('Example post from Worker'); //your code here
    });
    //or
    var worker = Worker.create("self.postMessage('Example post from Worker');"); //from string

### Usage example for Worker.createURL:

Use when you need multiple workers!
 
    var worker_url = Worker.createURL(function(e){  //from function
      self.postMessage('Example post from Worker'); //your code here
    });
    //or
    var worker_url = Worker.createURL("self.postMessage('Example post from Worker');"); //from string

now reuse worker_url as often as you want.

    var worker1 = new Worker(worker_url);
    var worker2 = new Worker(worker_url);
    ....
